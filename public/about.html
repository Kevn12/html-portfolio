<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My Name is Kevin. I try to learn coding with the course of Dr. Angela. This is my first ever Website, that I created on my on.</p>

<p>Later on, I want to use the knowledge IÂ´ve gained (hopefully enough of HTML, CSS and JavaScript) through this course. <br /> 
  I want to build websites for other people.</p>

<p>Maybe some day, it will be a small business. I could generate a small side income.</p>
